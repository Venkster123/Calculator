Rename classes to upper case:
	- element -> Vector
	- functor -> Function
	- zcomplex -> Complex

Remove the inheritance connection between the operations and the general token
class.

Later remove the immediate transition from i to the imaginary number; if indeed
the user has not yet defined a variable i, then make i equal to the imaginary
number.

Change printing of vectors and matrices to [...] and [[...]...] (add modes for
printing)
