==========
Additions:
==========

Add API functions as standard with lexing/parsing. Otherwise allow Function
objects to refer to C/C++ functions.

Add a data set class for arbitary input/output dimensions. Use its structure to
make regression techiniques smoother. Add items like Vandermonde matrices, and
such.

Add Gaussian elimination.

Add more general matrix/vector concatenation operations.

==============
Modifications:
==============

Remove the inheritance connection between the operations and the general token
class. (Replace instead with operation_holder)

Later remove the immediate transition from i to the imaginary number; if indeed
the user has not yet defined a variable i, then make i equal to the imaginary
number.

Standards:
