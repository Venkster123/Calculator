==========
Additions:
==========

Add API functions as standard with lexing/parsing. Otherwise allow Function
objects to refer to C/C++ functions.

Add a data set class for arbitary input/output dimensions. Use its structure to
make regression techiniques smoother. Add items like Vandermonde matrices, and
such.

Add Gaussian elimination.

Add more general matrix/vector concatenation operations.

==============
Modifications:
==============

Remove the inheritance connection between the operations and the general token
class. (Replace instead with operation_holder)

Later remove the immediate transition from i to the imaginary number; if indeed
the user has not yet defined a variable i, then make i equal to the imaginary
number.

Change operation factory in node.h.

Make operations and classes more efficient, i.e. computation of complex numbers
or polynomials, etc. Test the speedup through benchmark tests.

Try compiling the parser/lexer instead of including them.

=====
Bugs:
=====

Rational class has problems comparing with zero (perhaps even other integers).
Also cannot use unary minus operator, fix this.

==========
Standards:
==========

------------
Class names:
------------
	- Classes which are meant to be hidden to the user should be lower case
	- Usable classes (polynomials, functions, vectors, matrices, etc.)
	  should be upper case
