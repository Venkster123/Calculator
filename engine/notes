Class naming:
	- Classes which are meant to be hidden to the user should be lower case
	- Usable classes (polynomials, functions, vectors, matrices, etc.)
	  should be upper case

Remove the inheritance connection between the operations and the general token
class. (Replace instead with operation_holder)

Later remove the immediate transition from i to the imaginary number; if indeed
the user has not yet defined a variable i, then make i equal to the imaginary
number.

Add API functions as standard with lexing/parsing. Otherwise allow Function
objects to refer to C/C++ functions.
