# Zhetapi ℤHΠ

Zhetapi (ℤHΠ) is a C++ computation library that was built in the hopes of
making mathematical computation and algorithmic research more convenient to the
users.

This project is a work in progress.

## Features

The Zhetapi library comes with many abilities. They are listed below:

### Evaluation of Complex Expressions

The library can evaluate complex expressions, which have operands of various
types, such as integers, rational numbers, complex numbers, vectors and
matrices.

The framework of library allows the evaluation to be sensitive to certain types of
operations and their corresponding operations. For example, multiplication of
two integers yields and integers, the division of two rational numbers stays
rational, and the product of a matrix with integer components with a rational
scalar yields a matrix with rational components.

The `expression.h` header contains the functions `expr` and `exprf` to evaluate
expressions represented by strings. The difference is that `exprf` takes a
formatted string, while `expr` takes in a string object.

```{cpp}
// Not formatted, prints "1.0"
cout << (expr <double, int> ("1 + 2!/2.0"))->str() << endl;

// Formatted, also prints "1.0"
cout << (exprf <double, int> ("%d + %d!/2.0", 1, 2))->str() << endl;
```

### Customization of Operands

As mentioned in above, the engine is sensitive to overloads of certain
operations. In addition, users can create their own set of operations and
corresponding overloads or add more overloads.

As of right now, however, due to the way in which the engine parses expressions,
one cannot add new symbols for operations.

### Usage and Declaration of Variables

The library provides constructs which allow the user to store variables and retrieve
them in the scope of a certain setting space. Users can then refer to these
variables, and their values can be retrieved or changed.

### User Defined Functions

Users can create their own mathematical functions, which can then be used as any
other C++ functor object.

### Calculus

An object of class `Function` can be differentiated in any variable its
variables, to get its gradients and such. This process is symbolic, which has
the advantage that one has a closed form for the derivative, but the
disadvantage that it could be very complicated.

### Linear Algebra

The library also provides way in which the user can do linear algebra. The
classes `Vector` and `Matrix` come with a variety of methods on their own, which
include performing computation as well as manipulation of their representations.

In addition to these classes, the library provides standard algorithms such Gram
Schmidt and LU Factorization (see below).

### Standard Algorithms

In addition to a collection of classes the library provides, there are also
common standard algorithms which are implemented such as gradient descent and
root finding, as well as Gram Schmidt and LU factorization, a mentioned above.

Below are the currently implemented algorithms.

|===

| Function Name	| Description | Engine Header

| `gram_schmidt` | Performs the Gram Schmidt process on the given
set of vectors.	| `algorithm.h`

| `gram_schmidt_normalized` | Same as `gram_schmidt` but returns a basis of
normalized vectors. | `algorithm.h`

| `lagrange_interpolate` | Performs Lagrange interpolation on the given set of
points. Returns the appropriate polynomial. | `algorithm.h`

| `lu_factorize` | Returns the LU factorization of a matrix. | `algorithm.h`

| `solve_linear_equation` | Solves the linear equation `Ax = b` given `A` and
`b`. | `algorithm.h`

| `reduced_polynomial_fitting` | Returns a polynomial which goes through the
given set of points. Differs from `lagrange_interpolate` in that it returns a
simplified polynomial. | `algorithm.h`

| `gradient_descent` | Applies gradient descent to a given function on the given
set of data. | `algorithm.h`

| `find_root` | Uses Newton's method to find the root of the given function. |
`algorithm.h`

| `solve_hlde_constant` | Solves the homogeneous linear differential equation
with constant coefficients represented by the given polynomial. Returns a list
of functions as a basis to the solution space. | `calculus.h`

| `bernoulli_sequence_real` | Generates the first `n` terms of the Bernoulli
sequence. | `combinatorial.h` 

| `bernoulli_sequence_rational` | Generates the first `n` terms of the Bernoulli
sequence as rational numbers. | `combinatorial.h` 

| `bernoulli_number_real` | Generates the `n` th Bernoulli number.
| `combinatorial.h` 

| `bernoulli_number_rational` | Generates the `n` th Bernoulli number as a
rational number.
| `combinatorial.h`

supports computation of mathematical expressions and it also provides graphing
capabilities.

## Upcoming Features

### Simplification of Functions

Currently, the `Function` objects lack the complete ability to simplify their
representations. (Some of this functionality does already exist, such as the
fact that adding/subtracting by 0 and multiplying/dividing by 1 are trivial
actions.) For example, it is not yet possible to have the object recognize that
`3xy + 5yx` is the same as `8xy`. This feature would also help in stabilizing
the expanding complication of derivatives.

### Integration

Although differentiation is a current feature, integration is not. This feature
will be implemented as soon as the current framework has been properly placed.

### Exact Forms of Numbers

One recognizes, simply by looking at the first few digits, that the number
`3.141592` is most nearly pi, and that the number `2.7182817` is most nearly
Euler's number. The hope is that at some point, the library will be able to
reach similar conclusions, through the help of integer relations algorithms such
as PSLQ.

### More Algorithms in Linear Algebra

Although there are a few standard linear algebra algorithms, the hope is that
more will be added. These include QR factorization, SVD, diagonalization, etc.

### Machine Learning

A solid foundation for linear algebra is already present in the library. The
next move would be to implement machine learning utilities, such as Deep Neural
Networks.
