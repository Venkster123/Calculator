Things That Need to be Done:
 - add big 3 to each class
   and operators for comparison
   and equality (no need for math operators)
 - expand the exception tree for
   each class, make exception handling
   more advanced
 - add exception handling in operation
   class to check if passed data type is
   an operand, if not then throw an
   illegal type error
 - add te big 5 once having understood
   move semantics and r-value references
